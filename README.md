# Project Title

Employee Tracker, Challenge 03

## Description

Working in a partially completed JS file and using provided HTML and CSS files, I added JavaScript that activates the Employee Tracker app. The app collects user input about employees including first and last names and salary. With this data, it creates a table on the HTML page displaying the employee names sorted by last name along with their salaries. It also console logs the employees in the order they were added and then reports the number of employees and their average salary. Finally it selects one employee at random as the winner of a drawing.

## Installation

Employee Tracker requires no installation.

## Usage
You can see a screen shot of my portfolio page below. To link to my page, click [here](https://matthewwilliamscmh.github.io/EmployeeTracker).

Users click the "Add Employees" button and are prompted to provide a first name, a last name, and a salary. Users are then asked if they would like to add additional employees. If they do, the prompt sequence repeats. If they do not, a table of employees is generated, and the console logs the employee data, an average of their salaries, and the random winner of a drawing.

## Credits

I did a lot of googling for how to execute the data-collection sequence for this app. Among the most helpful sites were [SheCodes](https://www.shecodes.io/athena/), [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org), and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com).
